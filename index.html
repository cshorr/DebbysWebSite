<p>It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

    The regular crowd shuffles in

    There's an old man sittin' next to me

    Makin' love to his tonic and gin

    He says, "Son can you play me a memory?

    I'm not really sure how it goes

    But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete

    When I wore a younger man's clothes"

    La, la-la, di-di-da

    La-la di-di-da da-dum

    Sing us a song, you're the piano man

    Sing us a song tonight

    Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

    And you've got us feelin' alright

    Now John at the bar is a friend of mine

    He gets me my drinks for free

    And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke

     </p>
<P>BREAKING NEWS>>>>>>This Just in (explosions in the distance ) ! ALIENS from space are attacking the earth get to safety if you can (static noises)   run for your livvvvvvvvvvv shhhhh(static noises......... </P>
<br>
<p>But there's some place that he'd rather be

    He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"

    As a smile ran away from his face

    "Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star

    If I could get out of this place"

    Oh, la, la-la, di-di-da

    La-la di-di-da da-dum

    Now Paul is a real estate novelist

    Who never had time for a wife

    And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy

    And probably will be for life

    And the waitress is practicing politics

    As the businessmen slowly get stoned

    Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness

    But it's better than drinkin' alone

    Sing us the song, you're the piano man

    Sing us a song tonight

    Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

    And you've got us feelin' alright

    It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday

    And the manager gives me a smile

    'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see

    To forget about life for a while

    And the piano, it sounds like a carnival

    And the microphone smells like a beer

    And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar

    And say man what are you doin' here?

    Oh, la, la-la, di-di-da

    La-la di-di-da da-dum

    Sing us the song, you're the piano man

    Sing us a song tonight

    Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

    And you've got us feelin' alright</p>
